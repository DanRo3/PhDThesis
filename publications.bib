abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks for text categorization allows the extraction of features from the text represented through word embedding. The high dimensionality of the texts themselves implies a larger number of network parameters and a more complex optimization surface. Artificial neural network training is an NP-Hard optimization problem, which has been addressed by methods based on partial derivatives of the objective function and presents several theoretical and practical limitations, such as the probability of convergence to local minimums. In this work, we propose a hybrid method based on the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for training a Convolutional Neural Network. For this, we train together gradient-based methods with the Estimation of Multivariate Normal Algorithm and Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm by dividing the training process into two stages. The different variants obtained with the proposed method are compared with gradient-based methods on public benchmark datasets and statistical differences are analyzed by nonparametric tests. The proposed method increases the accuracy of the convolutional network applied to the text categorization task and overcome in about 0.22{\%}–24{\%} the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the methods used to submit our results to the Rest-Mex Sentiment Analysis of the Iberian Languages Evaluation Forum 2022. The addressed challenge proposes a sentiment analysis task of Spanish opinions, categorizing each message into five emotions, and an attraction prediction subtask divided into three categories. Accordingly, our contribution is a hybrid method based on the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms for fine-tuning an mT5-based transformer. For this, we propose the design and development of a deep learning model using the encoder part of the pre-trained mT5-based transformer. The proposed model is trained by dividing the process into two stages using AdamW and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy. With this approach, 0.3050 of Mean Absolute Error was obtained for the polarity detection subtask and 0.9781 of Macro F-measure for the attraction prediction subtask, reaching the 10th place out of the 24 teams in competition.},
